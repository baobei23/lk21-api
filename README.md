### Environment Variables

The target URLs have the potential to change at any time because their servers are extremely vulnerable to being blocked. Therefore, I declared the target URLs in the Node environment variables.

```bash
# LK21 (LayarKaca21) URL
LK21_URL = https://tv.lk21official.live

# NontonDrama URL
ND_URL = https://tv.nontondrama.lol
```
